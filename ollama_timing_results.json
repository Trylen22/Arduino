=== Batch Analysis at 21:04:10 ===
1. The overall temperature trend indicates a slight increase from the average (21.0°C to 26.2°C) within the given time period, suggesting a warming trend.

Batch Statistics:
• Average: 21.0°C
• Range: 19.0°C to 26.2°C
• Samples: 20



=== System Analysis at 21:15:30 ===
Current State: COOLING
Temperature: 17.5°C (-1.33°C/min)
Range: 17.5°C to 19.6°C

Component Status:
• Heater: inactive
• Fan: active
• Temperature Control: out of range

Engineer's Analysis:
1. The system is operating below the target temperature range (20-25°C) and cooling rapidly, suggesting an issue with either the heating element or microcontroller control. The cooling fan might also be malfunctioning if it's running at full speed when there's no need for active cooling.
